# API's Project
The Hip Hip Array's are back and are creating a spectacular project filled with amusing fashion choices, and a comforting, warming, delightfully sassy fashion expert who guides your daily fashion choices based on the weather.

## What
We are building a fashion recommendation service that connects to your local weather.

## How
We are going to access the API **Open Weather** and **Zalando**. We need an API Key for **Open Weather** but **Zalando** is free. Just to make our lives that bit easier.

## Why
Because freedom of speech is dead.

## Stretch Goals
- Incorporating quotes API.
- Present back of outfit as well as front.
- Total basket cost.
- Make images add an HTML link so you can buy from the web page directly.
